# Introduction to Pytest and Mocker

This document serves as an introduction to using pytest along with the mocker plugin to write and manage tests in Python projects. We'll explore how to leverage these tools to create robust and maintainable tests, focusing on mocking and patching techniques to isolate test environments and ensure accurate results.

## Pytest Overview

Pytest is a powerful testing framework for Python that simplifies the process of writing simple unit tests as well as complex functional tests. It supports fixtures for setup and teardown, markers for categorizing tests, and parameterization to run tests with different inputs.

### Key Features

- **Simple syntax**: Tests are easy to write and understand.
- **Fixtures**: Reusable pieces of code for test setup and teardown.
- **Parameterization**: Run tests with different parameters using a single test function.
- **Extensive plugin support**: Enhance pytest functionality with plugins.

## Mocker Plugin

The mocker plugin extends pytest with simplified mocking capabilities, wrapping around the standard `unittest.mock` library. It provides a fixture-based approach for mocking, which fits naturally with pytest's structure.

### Using `mocker.patch`

`mocker.patch` is used to temporarily replace an object in a specific module with a mock during the test. This is useful for isolating the unit under test by replacing its dependencies with mocks.

#### Example

```python
mocker.patch('app.api.invitation.generate_invitation_token', return_value="unique_token_123")
```

In this snippet, `generate_invitation_token` is replaced with a mock that always returns *"unique_token_123"*, isolating the test from the actual token generation logic.

#### Using `mock.MagicMock`

`mock.MagicMock` is a versatile mock object that can mimic Python objects. It's useful when you need a mock to behave like an object with methods and attributes.

##### Example

```python
mocker.patch(
    'app.db.crud.CRUDBase.create',
    return_value=mock.MagicMock()
)
```

Here, the `create` method of `CRUDBase` is replaced with a `MagicMock`, isolating the test from the database layer.

### Using `mock.side_effect`

`side_effect` can be used to raise exceptions or to dynamically change the return value of the mock based on input arguments.

#### Example

```python
mocker.patch(
    'app.api.invitation.send_email_background',
    side_effect=Exception("Email Service Down")
)
```

This simulates an exception being raised when `send_email_background` is called, useful for testing error handling.

## Asserting Mock Calls

- **`assert_called_once_with`**: Checks if the mock was called exactly once with the specified arguments.
- **`assert_called_once`**: Checks if the mock was called exactly once, regardless of arguments.

### Example

```python
mock_send_email.assert_called_once_with(
    background_tasks=mock.ANY,
    subject=f'Invitation to Join {invitation_data["organization"]}',
    email_to=invitation_data["email"],
    body=mock.ANY
)
```

This assertion verifies that `send_email_background` was called once with specific arguments, using `mock.ANY` to ignore the exact value of some arguments.

## Additional Functions and Attributes

- **`mock.call_args`**: Allows inspection of the arguments that a mock was called with.
- **`mock.call_count`**: Returns the number of times the mock was called.
- **`mock.reset_mock()`**: Resets the mock to its initial state.
- **`mock.return_value`**: Sets a fixed value to be returned when the mock is called.

## Parameterized Testing with Pytest

Pytest's `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator enables running the same test function with different sets of arguments, enhancing test coverage efficiently.

### Example

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("missing_field", ["email", "organization", "organizational_role", "role"])
```

This runs the decorated test function once for each item in the list, with `missing_field` taking the value of each item in turn.

## Conclusion
Pytest, along with the mocker plugin, offers a comprehensive solution for writing and managing tests in Python. By understanding and utilizing these tools, developers can create more robust, maintainable, and efficient test suites.
